I am an NSF Graduate Research Fellow in Astronomy & Astrophysics at Harvard University, where I use N-body simulations to study the detailed dynamics of tidally-disrupted globular clusters (stellar streams). 

I received my B.S. in Physics and Astronomy & Astrophysics from _the_ Ohio State University and am originally from Columbus, OH.
