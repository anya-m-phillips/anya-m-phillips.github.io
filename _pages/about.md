I am an incoming NSF Graduate Research Fellow in Astronomy & Astrophysics at Harvard University. I am interested in (binary) stellar evolution, stellar populations, and Galactic evolution and dynamics.

I received my B.S. in Physics and Astronomy & Astrophysics from _the_ Ohio State University and am originally from Columbus, OH.
