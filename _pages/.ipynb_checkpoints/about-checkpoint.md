I am an astronomy student interested in (binary) stellar evolution and populations, and Galactic evolution. I am an incoming Astronomy & Astrophysics PhD student at Harvard University.

I received my B.S. in Physics and Astronomy & Astrophysics from (_The_) Ohio State University and am originally from Columbus, OH.
